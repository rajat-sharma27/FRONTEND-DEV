Assignment 9 - HTML & CSS files
- Each question has its own HTML and CSS file with descriptive filenames (not q1.html).
- Open index.html to navigate to each page.
- All pages are static and require no JavaScript or external frameworks.
- Placeholder images use via.placeholder.com. If you want local images included, tell me and I'll replace them and rebuild the zip.
