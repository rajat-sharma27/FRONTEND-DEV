Assignment 8 - HTML & CSS files
- Each question has its own HTML and CSS file: q1.html, q1.css ... q10.html, q10.css
- Open index.html to navigate to each page.
- All pages are static and require no JavaScript or external frameworks.
- Some pages use placeholder images hosted on via.placeholder.com (an external image host). If you need fully offline images, let me know and I will include local image files instead.
